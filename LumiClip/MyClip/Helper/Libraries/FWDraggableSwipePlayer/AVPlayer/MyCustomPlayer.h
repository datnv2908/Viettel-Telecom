 @discussion Setting this property to 1.0 will play the media at its natural rate. Ability to set a different value is limited to the rates supported by the media item; if an unsupported rate is requested, playbackRate will not change.

This property will have no effect when ads are being played, or when casting. Cannot be set to 0; to pause playback, please call the pause method.
